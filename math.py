print(50 + 50) # Adds 2 numbers together.
print(50 - 50) # Subtracts 2 numbers from each other.
print(50 * 50) # Multiplies 2 numbers together.
print(50 / 50) # Divides 2 numbers from each other.
print(50 + 50 - 50 * 50 / 50) # PEMDAS ~ The order of operations for mathematical expressions involving more than 1 operator.
print(50 ** 50) # Exponents ~ Make it easier to write and use many multiplications
print(50 % 6) # Gives us a percentage of 2 numbers
print(50 // 6) # Divides 2 numbers from each other and does not give us the fraction/decimal forms.
